# firebase-authentification
practicing authentication using firebase and react js

inspired from web dev simplified video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKwu15ldZ7k

updated all the old features (old firebase syntax, react router v6, used tailwind instead of bootstrap, optimized the private routes)
